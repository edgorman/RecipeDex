# Sprint Planning

This page will describe the planned development process and include any relevant updates.

## Sprints

These will last approximately 2 weeks but may shift on my availability and priorities.

### Sprint 1

* Set up developer environment with python installed
* Set up recipedex module and initial structure
* Set up frontend/backend and make hello world application

### Sprint 2

* Implement core features of recipedex, including:
  * Parsing of all popular recipe websites
  * Storage of recipes in local database
  * Basic search and filtering of recipes

### Sprint 3

* Build bare-bones frontend components
* Build complimentary backend components
* Possibly setup other VMs if required

### Sprint 4

* Deploy the application on a cloud platform
  * This will likely be difficult so no other tasks

### Sprint 5
