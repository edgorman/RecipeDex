# RecipeDex
A Software as a Service (SAAS) application for storing, indexing and searching recipes from all across the web. Makes use of the [Recipe Scraper Package](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers) combined with bespoke NLP. Back-end developed in [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), front-end developed in [React](https://reactjs.org/). Planned deployment as a service in the cloud coming 2023.
