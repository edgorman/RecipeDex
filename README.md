# RecipeDex

This is the RecipeDex app that allows user to ingest, extract and edit recipes found from any online webiste in a quick and easy service. In addition to this users may also generate a summary of multiple recipes as an overview and to provide a combined list of ingredients needed to make each dish.

The app is designed as a containerised cloud-based SAAS that is deployed on GCP using Cloud Run. Continuous delivery is implemented via GitHub workflows including testing/linting and automatic deployment.
