# RecipeDex
A Software as a Service (SAAS) application for storing, indexing, and searching recipes from most recipes on the internet. A full-stack web application based on the FARM stack including [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Planned deployment to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) coming 2023.

## Description

All too often recipes are listed on websites that contain many burdensome ads as well as long paragraphs that are irrelevant to the task at hand. This will not be the first website to extract a recipe from a given URL, but it does aim to be one that gives a greater experience in regards to search functionality and ability to manipulate ingredients quickly and easily.
